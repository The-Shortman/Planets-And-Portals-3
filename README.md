# Planets And Portals 3
An in-development modpack for Minecraft Forge 1.20.1
This is the official repository for the Planets and Portals 3 modpack, soon to be available on Curseforge. Reporting issues and making suggestions is to be done in the Issues tab on this repository and nowhere else. It makes it much easier to keep track of everything <3

If you're looking to simply play the modpack, it is recommended you download it from Curseforge, not here.

**Current version: Pre-release v001**

## Playtesters
This repository is for the most up-to-date development build. The most stable/complete release of the pack for the Curseforge launcher can be found on the discord server in the Releases channel. You should also be able to use it with other modded launchers like Prism. It is recommended that you use Prism.

You **can** share this pack with your friends, just ask them to join the discord server as well, so I can credit them for playtesting, and so they can report issues.

As to your credit in the Credits quest chapter, it will be added in the next update :)

If you wish to host a dedicated server, feel free to do so. If you have any issues setting one up let me know as I've had my pain in modifying this to make a server pack every time I update it, or you can use either e4mc or the Essential mod to host it from your client for free:
